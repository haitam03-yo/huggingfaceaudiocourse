# Unit 4. Build a music genre classifier


# Pre-trained models and datasets for audio classification

in classification we use an encoder only arhcitecture, the becoder over complicate the task and the same for encoder-dercoder architecture, to use a pre trained model we need to sure for a model in the hud that is pre trainted with the same number of classes that we want our model to detect and then we finetune it, there are multiple classification tasks


## Keyword Spotting

findind some keyword in the audio

### Speech Commands

the task is to detect which command is said in the audio

## Language Identification (LID)

identify whihc language is spoken


## Zero-Shot Audio Classification

the problem with classification model is that we can't genralize them to more labels for exemple a model that detect which language can not detect
